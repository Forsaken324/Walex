You can install packages for nodejs using the npm package manager

npm install <package name>

to save the package to your package.json file, where you have all your dependencies, you can use the -S flag

the difference between devDependencies and dependencies is that the former contains development tools such as testing packages, while the other is bundled with the application during production.

As for the optionalDependencies the difference is that build failure of the dependency will not cause installation to fail. But its your programs responsibility to handle the lack of the dependency.

you can update a package using the command 

npm update

you can install a specific version by running

npm install packagename@version
