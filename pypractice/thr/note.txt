when you create a thread, you pass it a function and a list containing the arguments to that function

threading.get_indent() -> this returns a unique name for each thread, but the names are usually neither short or easily readable

In computing, a Daemon is a thread that runs in the background.

In python threading, a daemon thread will shut down immediately when the program exits.

When your python program ends, part of the shutdown process is to clean up the threading routine.
