in php, the keywords if else while and echo are not case sensitive

// in php, variables can be declared anywhere in the script, the scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced or used

the scopes are

local, global, static

// the print can also be used as echo, the print function only takes one argument. echo is marginall faster than print, print returns a value of 1 while echo 
// does not return any value.

// if your are displaying variables, you have to enclose them in double quotes, if you enclose them in single quotes, you will have to make use of string interpolation to
print out the variables

// a constant is an identifier for a simple value, constants cannot be changed during the script

a valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, but no constant name
